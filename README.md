## What Was Accomplished

* HTML was refactored to have better semantic meaning.
* The structure of the HTML is logical and independent of styling.
* Image elements now have accessible alt tags with descriptive text.
* The heading elements seemed to already be in order so no changes were made.
* A descriptive title was added.
* Consolidated CSS selectors.
* Commented CSS file.
